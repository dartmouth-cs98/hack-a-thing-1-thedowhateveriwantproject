## Description
I attempted to build the space debris game described in this two part tutorial series: https://www.raywenderlich.com/772-introduction-to-unity-getting-started-part-1-2. A lot of building the game had to do with playing around with the unity interface itself. It was a blast to work with.

## Who did what
So funny thing is, I actually worked a little with YiFei over the weekend on AR (we parrallel programmed), but then decided monday it was better to split ways and work on separate repo's on different tech to help diversify the tech used.

## What you learned
Unity is really awesome, I got to learn about how components and game objects work as well as the amazing amount of flexibility you have with the unity interface to design exactly what you want.

## What didnâ€™t work
I was using the most up-to-date version of Unity and the tutorial above was from 3 years ago using an older version. Therefore there were bugs related to movement of the spaceship.
