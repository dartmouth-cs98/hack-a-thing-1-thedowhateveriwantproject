# hack-a-thing-1-thedowhateveriwantproject

## Description
I attempted to build the space debris game described in this two part tutorial series: https://www.raywenderlich.com/772-introduction-to-unity-getting-started-part-1-2. A lot of building the game had to do with playing around with the unity interface itself. It was a blast to work with.

## Who did what
So funny thing is, I actually worked a little with YiFei over the weekend on AR (we parrallel programmed), but then decided monday it was better to split ways and work on separate repo's on different tech to help diversify the tech used.

## What you learned
Unity is really awesome, I got to learn about how components and game objects work as well as the amazing amount of flexibility you have with the unity interface to design exactly what you want.

## What didn’t work
I was using the most up-to-date version of Unity and the tutorial above was from 3 years ago using an older version. Therefore there were bugs related to movement of the spaceship.

# hack-a-thing-2 UPDATE *******

## Description
In this continuation of my first hack a thing, I actually used a different technology (react-native) and did something I have never done before: I integrated the unity 3d application I built in the first part into a react native app that I built in this part.

Below is the tutorial I used for building the basic react native app:
https://levelup.gitconnected.com/getting-started-with-react-native-in-2019-build-your-first-app-a41ebc0617e2

Additionally, below is the tutorial I additionally did to integrate the app with the unity3D project:
https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/integration-with-existing-apps.html

## What you learned
This hack a thing was fun because I integrated what was used in my previous hack a thing and integrated it into a new technology, I learned that unity is an incredibly flexible platform and the tools/support for integrating it with react-native are very developed. 

## How does this hack-a-thing inspire you or relate to your possible project ideas?
I am heavily leaning towards using unity in my cs98 project because it is fun to work with and there are so many applications, this hack a thing was important becuase part of using unity will be integrating it into a platform of choice like AR/VR or mobile. Getting my feet wet with that integration is important and gives me a better sense of what needs to be done if I decide to do that for my 98 project.

## What didn’t work

The project was carrying over some buggy unity code as explained above.
